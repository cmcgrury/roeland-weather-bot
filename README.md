# Roeland Weather Bot

This is a project I started to teach myself how to create discord apps, as well as touch up on python and continue learning how to use APIs.

## A discord app that displays (when prompted):
- Weather condition
- Temperature
- Feels like temperature
- Wind chill
- Precipitation in last hour
- Humidity
- Wind speed/direction
- Wind gusts
- UV level
- Sunrise/sunset time
- Time data was updated

## The app also automatically sends alerts to hard coded users when their hard coded city recieves a weather alert

## How to use:
- Use !weather "cityname" to get weather for a specific city, or !alert "cityname" to get weather alerts for a specific city.

## Features to add:
- Daily forecast sent out every day
- Potentially more

## Technologies used:
- Python
- Discord App
- WeatherAPI
